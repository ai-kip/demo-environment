## NOTES ON METHODOLOGY

1. **Size data is approximate.** Employee counts and revenues are based on the most recent publicly available data (press releases, company websites, DDW/Northdata records, ZoomInfo, Owler, Craft.co). Private Mittelstand companies rarely publish exact figures.

2. **Some companies exceed the sweet spot.** Companies like SEW-Eurodrive, Festo, Sick, Phoenix Contact, and Brose are included because they are frequently cited as exemplary Hidden Champions / Weltmarktfuehrer and serve as reference points for the target profile. Their smaller competitors or supplier-tier companies are often the actual sweet-spot targets.

3. **Revenue figures may include non-manufacturing revenue** (services, aftermarket parts). Manufacturing-only revenue is often lower.

4. **For prospecting**, the Tier 1 companies (especially #1-#40) represent the highest-probability ICP matches. These are the companies most likely to have the buying patterns, decision structures, and challenges that a Mittelstand-focused B2B solution addresses.

5. **Additional veins to mine for more companies:**
   - VDMA's 3,500+ member directory (requires login at vdma.org)
   - DDW's full Mittelstand 10.000 list (purchasable as Excel from die-deutsche-wirtschaft.de)
   - IHK regional Weltmarktfuehrer lists (especially South Westphalia, Hohenlohe, Schwaebisch Hall)
   - Munich Strategy's full TOP 100 PDF ranking (downloadable at munich-strategy.com)
   - Packaging Valley Germany e.V. member list (~50 companies in Baden-Wuerttemberg)
   - Handelsblatt / WirtschaftsWoche full rankings (behind paywall but browsable by company)
