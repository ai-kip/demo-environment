Subline: (And Your Team's Motivation)

SLIDE 2:

SLIDE 2:

Body: Right now, 95% of your target accounts aren't buying. They're not ignoring you - they're just not ready.

SLIDE 3:
--------
Label: The Mistake
Headline: Treating Everyone the Same
Body: Same emails. Same cadence. Same pitch. No wonder your reply rates are under 2%.

--------

--------

Subline: What If That Didn't Matter?

SLIDE 3:
--------
Label: The Reality

SLIDE 4:
--------
Label: The Question

CAROUSEL 5: THE PERFECT OUTREACH MESSAGE (Educational)
================================================================================

SLIDE 1 (Hook):
---------------
Headline: Your Cold Emails Aren't Working
Subline: Here's What's Missing

SLIDE 2:
--------
Label: Element #1
Headline: A Real Trigger
Body: "I saw your company is expanding..." beats "I hope this finds you well." Show you actually looked.

SLIDE 3:
--------
Label: Element #2
Headline: Their Specific Problem
Body: Not "companies like yours" - their actual challenge. Generic pain points get generic deletes.

SLIDE 4:
--------
Label: Element #3
Headline: Proof That Matters
Body: "We helped [similar company] achieve [specific result]" - one relevant case beats a feature list.

SLIDE 5:
--------
Label: Element #4
Headline: Clear, Specific Value
Body: "Save 6 hours weekly on research" hits harder than "improve sales efficiency." Be concrete.

SLIDE 6:
--------
Label: Element #5
Headline: One Easy Ask
Body: "Worth a 15-min chat Thursday?" Not "I'd love to schedule a call to discuss synergies." Keep it human.

Headline: Trigger + Pain + Proof + Value + Ask

Body: Your EUR 80K rep spends 30% of time researching. That's EUR 24K/year - before they make a single call.

SLIDE 3:
--------
Label: The Multiplier
Headline: Wrong Leads Cost Double
Body: Every hour on a bad-fit prospect is an hour not spent on a real opportunity. The cost compounds.

SLIDE 4:
--------
Label: The Benchmark
Headline: What Others Pay
Body: B2B companies spend EUR 150-400 per qualified lead. What's your actual cost when you add research time?
