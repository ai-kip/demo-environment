# Sales Process -- How We Sell

> **Last updated:** 2026-02-09

## Overview

AI-KIP's sales process is consultative, workshop-based, and strongly focused on personal relationships. We don't sell features -- we conduct discovery conversations that already deliver value to the prospect.

---

## Sales Phases

### Phase 1: Qualification & First Conversation

**Goal:** Understand whether the prospect fits and what pain points exist.

**Discovery Deep-Dive Questions:**
1. What's your go-to-market? Direct or indirect?
2. Do you have partners? Distributors?
3. What's the revenue split between direct and indirect?
4. Does it change by geography?
5. What are your priorities for 2026?
6. What's the limiting factor right now?
7. Who is your main target group?
8. How many salespeople do you have? Calls per day?
9. How many active customers? How many potential per rep?
10. What's the average margin?

**Important:** These questions are not optional -- they are the core of the sales process. We must deeply understand the prospect's business model.

**Framework:** Every sales conversation follows the **SPICED** structure:
- **S**ituation -- Understand the current state
- **P**ain -- Identify what's not working
- **I**mpact -- Quantify the business impact
- **C**ritical Event -- Find the trigger/deadline for action
- **E** (formerly D) -- Decision -- Map the decision process and criteria

See `product/frameworks.md` for full SPICED documentation.

### Phase 2: Demo with Real Data

**Goal:** Show what AI-KIP can concretely deliver for the prospect.

**Approach:**
> "What would be very interesting, if you have a list of 50 companies... we can already generate a list and put that into a demo."

- Prospect provides 50+ existing customers (domains or company names)
- AI-KIP generates lookalikes and shows signals
- Demo is individually tailored to industry and context

**Never:** Show a generic standard demo.

### Phase 3: Workshop (optional / recommended)

**Goal:** Ingest deep information about the client and their strategy to define where the biggest levers for impact with AI Agents are.

**Format:**
- 1-day onsite at the customer (preferred)
- Price: EUR 2,500 (communicated openly)
- Uses structured workshop presentation covering: mission/vision alignment, value chain analysis, use case identification, agentic opportunities prioritization, and AI agent roadmap

> "We start with a one day workshop for 2,500 EUR to ingest a lot of info about the client and its strategy, to define where the biggest levers for impact with AI Agents are."

### Phase 4: Proof of Concept

**Goal:** Validation with real data and real results.

- Based on workshop results
- Measurable goals defined
- Typical timeframe 4-8 weeks

### Phase 5: Implementation & Partnership

**Goal:** Build a long-term partnership.

- Engagement spectrum from "full service" to "learning session"
- Co-development option for strategic partners (very selective)
- Regular reviews and optimization

## Engagement Models

| Model | Description | For whom |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Full Service** | Complete implementation and ongoing support | Companies wanting maximum support |
| **Workshop + Implementation** | Workshop to define, then implementation | Standard entry point |
| **Learning Session** | Introduction and orientation | Prospects who want to understand first |
| **Co-Development** | Joint product development | Only for very few strategic partners |

> "We can imagine from let's say hire you for almost everything to just learn something today and see where it fits together."

## Sales Tactics

### Prefer In-Person
> "Then we can visit you in person in Ulm, which is always better to see each other."

Always suggest a personal meeting, especially for deeper conversations.

### Expand Stakeholders
Don't stop at a single contact. Actively ask about decision-makers and invite them to the next conversation.

> "It would be interesting that he participates also... I will talk to my boss about it."

### Proactively Send Materials
Don't wait for the prospect to ask for security/hosting info. Offer proactively.

> "Is there anything we can already send you on the concerns... where it's hosted, IT security?"

### Preparation is Everything
Before every demo: background research, create mock-ups, tailor the story to the prospect.

> "We need to now work in background so we can shift the story towards his faith... mock something up."

### Capacity Reframing
Reframe the prospect's data to reveal the optimization potential.

**Example:**
- Prospect says: "We have 3.5 calls per day."
- We say: "3.5 calls per day? Why? What are they doing the other 7 hours?"
- Prospect says: "We have 800 active customers."
- We calculate: "Each salesperson has 25 potential customers, of which 2-5 are buying. You're utilizing 1% of your capacity."

### Identify Multi-Brand Upsell
If the prospect works in a group: identify expansion into other brands and departments.

## Pricing Communication

### Workshop
- EUR 2,500 for a 1-day onsite workshop -- stated openly in conversation
- No hiding costs

### Platform
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) model
- Minimum contract: 1 year
- Range: EUR 2,500 -- 30,000 MRR depending on use cases and usage
- Not discussed in detail in first conversation -- only after demo/workshop when value is clear

### Sales Cycle
- Range: 2-4 weeks to 6 months
- Depends on company size, decision-making process, and number of stakeholders

### Principle
> Prices are communicated transparently and early. No "we'll send you a proposal" without prior discussion.

## CRM & Pipeline Management

### MEDDPICC Integration
Every deal is automatically scored using MEDDPICC:
- **M**etrics -- Which KPIs change?
- **E**conomic Buyer -- Who decides on budget?
- **D**ecision Criteria -- What criteria are used?
- **D**ecision Process -- How does decision-making work?
- **P**aper Process -- How does contracting work?
- **I**dentify Pain -- What's the core pain?
- **C**hampion -- Who fights for us internally?
- **C**ompetition -- Who are the alternatives?

### Bowtie Pipeline
Funnel visualization in 8 stages:
Awareness -> Education -> Selection (split by Partner/Direct, End Customer/Indirect)

## Complaint Handling

Personal, generous, direct:

> "I reached out to the person directly saying I'm so sorry... I want to offer you a voucher to go to dinner. And they were very happy."

**Principle:** Don't ignore or delegate complaints. CEO/founder responds personally.
