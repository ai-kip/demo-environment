## Current Channels

### Primary: Founder-Led LinkedIn
Michael Uenk, Micky Bronkhorst, and Malte Witt post on LinkedIn. Personal profiles have 2-5x more reach than company pages.

**LinkedIn profiles:**
- Michael Uenk (CEO): linkedin.com/in/michael-uenk/
- Micky Bronkhorst (COO): linkedin.com/in/micky-bronkhorst-436a0219/
- Company page: linkedin.com/company/ai-kip

**Current posting strategy:**
- 3-5 posts per week from personal accounts
- Content lanes: Tech/Product (Alex), Sales/Market (Michael/Malte), Transformation (Micky)
- Mix: Hot takes, stories, data, frameworks, behind-the-scenes
- Be opinionated -- the most engaging founder content takes a clear stance

**Planned evolution -- Role-based posting:**
- Alex Drozd (CTO): Technical thought leadership, AI/ML insights, product architecture
- Micky Bronkhorst (COO): Digital transformation, organizational change, operations
- Michael Uenk (CEO): Vision, strategy, market positioning, growth
- Malte Witt (MD DACH): German-language content for the DACH market

### Secondary: Personal Conversations & Events
In-person meetings are prioritized. Workshops as entry format.

LinkedIn carousels (pipeline and templates already exist in repository).

## Content Strategy Framework

### Anchor -> Derivative Model

```
Anchor Content (webinar, interview, long-form post)
  -> LinkedIn Post (DE)
  -> LinkedIn Post (EN)
  -> Blog article
  -> Newsletter excerpt
  -> Carousel (using existing pipeline tool)
  -> Social clips (if video)
```

### Content Pillars

| Pillar | Topics | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Thought leadership** | Fourth Pillar, AI silos, future of B2B | 1x/week |
| **Tactics & practice** | Frameworks, how-tos, calculation examples | 2x/week |
| **Customer success** | Case studies, metrics, before/after | 1x/week |
| **Behind the scenes** | Product development, team, decisions | 1x/week |
| **Market insights** | DACH-specific data, trends, benchmarks | 1-2x/month |

### Demand Gen vs. Lead Gen

Follow the Cognism model:
- **60-70% budget on demand creation:** Ungated content, LinkedIn, podcast, brand
- **30-40% on demand capture:** High-intent keywords, retargeting
- **Don't gate:** Make playbooks, courses, webinars freely accessible
- **Measure:** Self-reported attribution ("How did you hear about us?")

## Channel White Spaces (Validated Across N=17 Competitors)

### What NO competitor does (uncontested opportunities)

1. German-language B2B content marketing at scale
2. DACH-focused B2B community
3. DACH-focused podcast or newsletter
4. Events in DACH
5. YouTube as a primary channel (vs. content dump)
6. German-language academy/certification

**Each of these is an uncontested channel where AI-KIP can be first mover.**

---

## Region-Specific Channel Strategy

### DACH
- LinkedIn (personal brands) as main channel
- Content in German
- GDPR/compliance addressed proactively
- Indirect approach: attention first, then conversation
- In-person meetings preferred

### Benelux
- LinkedIn (more direct approach)
- Content in English
- Less compliance focus needed
- Faster sales cycles possible

## Product Roadmap & Channel Implications

| Module | Status | Channel Impact |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Sales Intelligence** | Live | Current focus of all content and GTM efforts |
| **Marketing Intelligence** | Next | Will open new content angles and audience segments |
| **Procurement Intelligence** | Future | Enables broader "whole organization" messaging |

> Content and channel strategy should evolve as new modules launch, gradually shifting from pure sales intelligence messaging to broader platform positioning.

---

## Partner Strategy

**Current status:** No active partner strategy in place.
**Future direction:** A partner program is planned but not yet defined. When activated, it will likely include:
- Technology partnerships (CRM/ERP integrations)
- Consulting/implementation partners
- Reseller/referral programs

> Until the partner program is formalized, all GTM efforts focus on direct sales and founder-led marketing.

## Gold Standard Content References

The following content represents the gold standard for AI-KIP's voice, tone, and quality:

- **LinkedIn carousels:** `carousel-template/Output final/` -- 6 finalized carousels covering core topics (AI Opportunity, Time Opportunities, 95:5 Rule, Scaling Without Limits, Perfect Outreach, ROI of Sales Intelligence)
- **LinkedIn company page:** linkedin.com/company/ai-kip -- description and details section
- **Pitch deck:** UZIN UTZ presentation is the closest to the standard sales intelligence pitch deck
