## Overview

AI-KIP uses several proprietary and adapted frameworks that structure our thinking and methodology. These frameworks are central to our consulting, workshops, and product development.

---

## 1. A.G.E.N.T. Framework (by Pascal Bornet)

The framework for designing and evaluating AI agents.

| Letter | Meaning | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **A** | Agent Identity | Who is the agent? Role, goal, personality |
| **G** | Gear & Brain | What tools and capabilities does the agent have? |
| **E** | Execution & Workflow | How does the agent execute tasks? |
| **N** | Navigation & Rules | What rules and boundaries apply? |
| **T** | Test & Trust | How is quality assured? |

**Usage:** Workshops, agent design, evaluation of existing AI initiatives.

---

## 2. SPAR Principles

How AI agents "think" -- the cognitive model behind our agents.

| Phase | Meaning | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **S** | Sense | Perceive environment, ingest data, detect signals |
| **P** | Plan | Develop strategy, prioritize tasks |
| **A** | Act | Execute actions, deliver results |
| **R** | Reflect | Evaluate results, learn, optimize |

**Usage:** Explaining agent logic, product architecture conversations.

---

## 3. TASC Method

Task management framework for working with AI agents.

| Element | Meaning | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **T** | Task | What is the task? Clearly defined goals |
| **A** | Authority | What permissions does the agent have? Boundaries of autonomy |
| **S** | Success | How do we recognize success? Measurable criteria |
| **C** | Checklist | What steps must be completed? |

**Usage:** Workshop exercises, agent configuration, onboarding.

---

## 4. Sweet Spot Formula

Method for identifying the best entry points for AI agents.

```
Sweet Spot = High Impact + High Feasibility + Low Effort
```

Three dimensions are evaluated:
1. **Impact:** How large is the business benefit?
2. **Feasibility:** How realistic is the implementation?
3. **Effort:** How high is the effort?

**Usage:** Golden Opportunities Workshop, prioritizing AI initiatives.

---

## 5. "Paint Done For Me"

Outcome visualization technique. Before an AI agent is developed, the desired end state must be clearly described:

> "Paint the result for me before you start."

**Principle:** Don't start with the technology, start with the desired outcome. What should be different once the agent is running?

**Usage:** Workshop entry, use case definition.

---

## 6. Three Layers Framework

Three levels of audience targeting in sales.

| Layer | Question | Method |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Layer 1: ICP** | Who is our ideal customer? | Lookalike analysis |
| **Layer 2: Buyer Persona** | Who is the right person? | Decision maker mapping |
| **Layer 3: Signals** | When is the right moment? | Signal intelligence |

**Usage:** Sales conversations, ICP workshops, positioning.

---

## 7. The Fourth Pillar

Organizational model that introduces Intelligence as the fourth dimension.

```
Organization = People + Process + Resources + Intelligence
```

| Pillar | Traditional | With AI-KIP |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| People | Employees | Employees + AI agents |
| Process | Business processes | AI-optimized processes |
| Resources | Budget, infrastructure | + Data as strategic resource |
| Intelligence | (missing) | Orchestrating AI layer |

> **Communication note:** The Fourth Pillar concept is for C-level and strategic conversations. In first contact and marketing, lead with concrete benefits. Internally we've learned: "People don't get the fourth pillar, it's too fake for them."

---

## 8. Bowtie Pipeline Model

Go-to-market visualization as a bowtie shape:

```
          AWARENESS -> EDUCATION -> SELECTION
                        |
               Partner <-> End Customer
              Indirect <-> Direct
```

8-stage funnel from awareness through education to selection, split by channel (partner, end customer, direct, indirect).

**Usage:** GTM strategy, pipeline reviews, sales conversations.

---

## 9. MEDDPICC (Adapted)

Sales qualification framework integrated into the platform.

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **M** | Metrics -- What KPIs define success? |
| **E** | Economic Buyer -- Who has budget authority? |
| **D** | Decision Criteria -- What criteria drive the decision? |
| **D** | Decision Process -- How does the decision process work? |
| **P** | Paper Process -- How does contracting work? |
| **I** | Identify Pain -- What is the core pain? |
| **C** | Champion -- Who fights for us internally? |
| **C** | Competition -- What are the alternatives? |

**Usage:** Automatic deal scoring in the platform.

---

## 10. Golden Opportunities Workshop

Workshop methodology for identifying AI opportunities, run in up to three sessions.

| Session | Focus | Duration |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Session 1: Business** | Understand business model, map value chains, identify use cases | 1 day |
| **Session 2: Refinement** | Deep-dive with topic experts on specific processes | Follow-up |
| **Session 3: Data Architecture** | Evaluate data landscape, enterprise information architecture | Follow-up |

**Price:** Workshop costs EUR 2,500 (communicated openly, covers Session 1).
**Output:** Prioritized list of AI initiatives with business case (Agentic Opportunities Prioritization Matrix).

### Workshop Roles

| Role | Type | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| **AI Agent Master** | External (AI-KIP facilitator) | Topic expert on Agentic AI, runs the workshop, storyteller who inspires creativity. Receives North Star briefing from leadership beforehand. |
| **Agent Owner** | Internal (customer) | Business owner taking ownership of AI Agent during MVP. Owns the internal backlog, makes decisions, trusted advisor to both employees and leadership. |
| **Business Process Specialist** | Internal or external | Uses SIPOC to map processes, defines entry/exit points for agents, applies TASC and "Paint Done For Me" to ensure clarity. |
| **Enterprise Data Architect** | Internal or external | Maps data streams (CRM, ERP, IoT, sensors), defines data clients, visualizes enterprise information architecture, identifies gaps. |

### Workshop Agenda (Session 1 -- Standard 1-Day Format)

1. Humans at the Centre -- AI agents as digital co-workers
2. WHY / HOW / WHAT -- North Star alignment
3. Get Inspired -- AI Agent Progression Framework, examples
4. Mission & Vision -- Align with customer's purpose
5. People, Process, Resources -- Map current state
6. Logic & Reasoning (SPAR) -- How agents think
7. Data Architecture -- Information flows and readiness
8. Unlock Intelligence -- Identify opportunities using Porter Value Chain
9. Build Agents -- A.G.E.N.T. Framework, prioritization, roadmap

### Adoption Model (Diffusion of Innovation)

Based on Everett Rogers' framework, AI Agent adoption follows three phases:

| Phase | Group | % of Organization | Action |
|-------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Innovators** | ~2.5% | Self-selecting, eager to pursue new ideas. Start here. |
| 2 | **Early Adopters** | To ~20% | Cross the adoption gap ("crossing the chasm"). |
| 3 | **Early Majority** | To ~50% | Adoption phase complete. Digital workforce is the new normal. |

**Key insight:** First agent should be implemented within 4 weeks and show measurable results within 3 months. People's daily behavior adapts after 66+ days of consistent use.

---

## 11. SPICED Framework

Sales discovery and qualification framework that guides every sales conversation.

| Element | Meaning | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **S** | Situation | What is the prospect's current state? Business model, team size, tools in use |
| **P** | Pain | What problems are they experiencing? What's not working? |
| **I** | Impact | What is the business impact of the pain? Revenue lost, time wasted, opportunities missed |
| **C** | Critical Event | What is the trigger or deadline? Why act now? |
| **E** | Decision | How will the decision be made? Who is involved, what criteria? |

**Usage:** Every sales conversation follows SPICED structure. Integrated with Revenue Architecture for data-driven, sprint-based coaching.

**Usage:** Workshop prioritization, roadmap planning, setting expectations with prospects.

---

## 14. Agentic Opportunities Prioritization Matrix

2x2 matrix for evaluating and prioritizing AI agent initiatives.

```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                        |
   Strategic Projects   |   Quick Wins
   (Plan carefully)     |   (Do first)
                        |
  ----------------------+----------------------
                        |
   Deprioritize         |   Fill-ins
   (Skip or defer)      |   (Do when capacity allows)
                        |
                    LOW IMPACT

         HIGH COMPLEXITY <-----> LOW COMPLEXITY
```

| Quadrant | Impact | Complexity | Action |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Quick Wins** | High | Low | Do first -- immediate value, low effort |
| **Strategic Projects** | High | High | Plan carefully -- significant value, needs resources |
| **Fill-ins** | Low | Low | Do when capacity allows -- easy but limited impact |
| **Deprioritize** | Low | High | Skip or defer -- not worth the effort now |

**Usage:** Workshop output prioritization, agent roadmap planning, resource allocation.

- MEDDPICC scores deals automatically
- AI agents surface coaching insights to the salesperson (not management)

**Sales Stages:**
1. **Prospect** -- Signal detected, company identified
2. **Connect** -- First outreach, conversation initiated
3. **Discover** -- SPICED deep-dive, pain and impact understood
4. **Propose** -- Tailored demo/workshop, value proposition delivered
5. **Close** -- Decision process managed, contract signed
6. **Expand** -- Upsell, cross-sell, referral generation

**Usage:** Platform pipeline view, sales coaching, deal reviews.
