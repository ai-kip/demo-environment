## Overview

GDPR compliance and data privacy are not an afterthought feature for AI-KIP -- they are a core part of the architecture and a central differentiator against US competitors.

> "Before I joined AI-KIP... I was a typical German always saying DSK file is not GDPR... we can install this locally."
> -- Malte Witt, MD DACH

## Hosting

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Cloud provider** | Schwarz IT / StackIT |
| **Location** | Germany |
| **Type** | German tech stack |
| **On-premise option** | Yes -- local installation on customer machine possible |
| **Private cloud** | Yes -- dedicated instance possible |

> "Everything is hosted here... Schwarz IT and StackIT... German tech stack. We can put it locally on a machine here in your headquarters if needed."

### Hosting Options

| Option | Description | For whom |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Cloud (Standard)** | Hosted at Schwarz IT/StackIT in Germany | Most customers |

## GDPR Compliance

### Architecture Principles

1. **Privacy by Design:** GDPR is built into the architecture, not retrofitted
2. **Data control with the user:** Employees always control which data is connected
3. **European data processing:** No data processing in the USA
4. **Minimal data storage:** Only necessary data is stored

### Data Sources and Lawfulness

AI-KIP's data comes from publicly accessible sources:

| Source | Type |
|--------|------|
| Trade registers | Public register |
| Dun & Bradstreet | Commercial data provider |
| Google Maps | Publicly verified |
| Chambers of commerce | Public registers |
| Additional registers | Everywhere a public register exists |

> "Chamber of commerce, Dun & Bradstreet, Google Maps verified... everywhere there is a register we pull in that data."

### Transcript Data (Meetings)

- Employees connect their **own** transcripts
- Employees always retain **control** over the data
- Data is **not** forwarded to management
- The system **mirrors** insights to the employee themselves

> "The salesperson itself can connect their own transcripts... they are always under the control of which data."

## Data Privacy vs. US Competitors

### Structural Advantages of AI-KIP

| Aspect | AI-KIP | Typical US Competitor |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **Hosting country** | Germany | USA (EU option at extra cost) |
| **Cloud provider** | Schwarz IT / StackIT | AWS / Azure / GCP |
| **On-premise** | Standard option | Usually not available |
| **EU data** | Included | Often separate product (e.g., ZoomInfo "Data Passport") |
| **GDPR architecture** | Native (by design) | Retrofitted |
| **Data residency** | 100% EU | Often US processing |

### Specific Competitor Weaknesses

| Competitor | GDPR Weakness |
|-----------|---------------|
| **ZoomInfo** | Separate "Global Data Passport" for EU data (hidden costs, friction) |
| **Apollo** | 60-70% data accuracy outside the US |
| **Gong** | US-only data residency |
| **11x, Artisan** | Minimal EU compliance positioning, no German-language materials |
| **Amplemarket** | US-centric, no EU-specific compliance |

## Communication Guidelines for Compliance

### Address Proactively -- Don't Wait for Objections

In DACH markets, prospects expect data privacy to be addressed **first**. Don't wait for the question.

**In every first conversation:**
1. Name the hosting location (Schwarz IT / StackIT, Germany)
2. Mention the on-premise option
3. Offer to send security/hosting documentation upfront

### Materials in German

German prospects expect compliance materials in German. English whitepapers are not sufficient.

### Be Specific

| Instead of | Better |
|-----------|--------|
| "We are cloud-compliant" | "Hosted at Schwarz IT and StackIT in Germany" |
| "We are GDPR-compliant" | "GDPR-native architecture, locally installable, data control with the user" |
| "Your data is safe" | "German tech stack, no US transfer, on-premise possible" |

---

## Empowerment vs. Surveillance

A critical compliance-adjacent point: AI-KIP must always be positioned as an **empowerment tool**, not a surveillance tool.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "Does my boss see what I'm doing?" | "No. Insights are mirrored to the employee themselves." |
| "Are my calls being monitored?" | "You connect your own transcripts. You retain control." |
| "Is this a monitoring tool?" | "It's an empowerment tool that helps you get to the sale faster." |

> "It will mirror it to the employee itself... it is always helping that person to get to the sale faster."
