## Sales Intelligence -- ICP

### Ideal Company

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Size** | 10-5,000+ employees with B2B sales |
| **Sales model** | Direct, indirect, or hybrid (partners/distributors) |
| **Prospect's target customers** | From craftsmen/1-2-person shops to enterprise |
| **Geography** | Primarily active in Europe |
| **CRM situation** | Existing, but often with data quality problems ("Name is correct, everything else is garbage") |
| **Pain points** | Too much time researching, too few qualified leads, no visibility into buying signals |

### Typical Sales Structures
- 5-50 salespeople
- Each rep has 20-30 potential customers, of which 2-5 are active buyers
- Average 3-5 calls per day (optimization potential: "What are they doing the other 7 hours?")
- Capacity utilization often below 10% ("99% of your capabilities are unutilized")

### Buying Triggers
- "My salespeople spend too much time researching instead of selling"
- "Our CRM data is outdated/incomplete"
- "We don't know which companies are ready to buy right now"
- "We want to expand into new markets but don't know where to start"
- Growth priorities (e.g., "Expansion into countries where we're not well known")
- Limiting factors in personnel ("The limiting factor is really the people, the human resources")

## Ideal Partner (Across Both Products)

AI-KIP is selective. Not every company fits. An ideal partner has:

1. **Something unique** -- a differentiated offering, not generic consulting
2. **Growth ambitions** -- wants to scale, not just maintain the status quo
3. **Openness to innovation** -- willing to go new ways
4. **No direct competition to existing partners** -- exclusivity is part of the offering

> "For you, you have something very unique. That's what I would love to work together with you."
> -- Michael Uenk

## Anti-Personas -- Who We DON'T Target

| Type | Why not |
|------|---------|
| **Generic consultancies** | No differentiated offering, doesn't fit our partnership model |
| **Companies without B2B sales** | Sales Intelligence is not relevant |
| **Pure feature buyers** | Want to check a box, not enter a partnership |
| **Companies looking for "cheapest solution"** | We are premium-positioned |
| **Direct competitors of existing partners** | Exclusivity is a core principle |
| **Companies that want AI as surveillance** | Contradicts our empowerment principle |

## Discovery Questions for ICP Qualification

Systematically clarify in every prospect conversation:

1. **Go-to-market:** Direct or indirect? Partners? Revenue split?
2. **Geography:** Which markets? Regional differences?
3. **Growth priorities:** What are the goals for 2026? Through 2030?
4. **Limiting factors:** What's the bottleneck? (People, processes, data?)
5. **Prospect's target group:** Who are their customers? Size? Industry?
6. **Capacity & activity:** How many salespeople? Calls per day? Meetings per week?
7. **Account structure:** How many active customers? Potential customers per rep? Average margin?
