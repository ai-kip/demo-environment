## Target Company Profile

### Firmographics

| Attribute | Ideal | Acceptable | Disqualifier |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Headquarters** | Germany | Austria, Switzerland | Outside DACH |
| **Company size** | 200-5,000 employees | 50-200 or 5,000+ | <20 employees (no B2B sales team) |
| **Revenue** | EUR 50M-500M | EUR 10M-50M or 500M+ | -- |
| **B2B sales team** | 10-50 salespeople | 5-10 or 50+ | No dedicated B2B sales function |
| **Sales model** | Direct + indirect (partners/distributors) | Direct only | Pure B2C |
| **International presence** | Active in multiple European markets | DACH-only | -- |
| **CRM** | In use but data quality issues | No CRM (greenfield) | -- |
| **AI maturity** | Exploring or early stage | Advanced (wants orchestration) | "We already have everything" |

### Industry Focus

| Tier | Industries | Examples | Why |
|------|-----------|----------|-----|
| **Tier 1** | Manufacturing / Industrial (B2B) | Building materials (UZIN UTZ), machinery, chemicals, automotive suppliers, industrial components | Companies that create physical products and sell them to other businesses. Large sales teams, complex buyer journeys, signal-rich markets. |
| **Tier 1** | IT / Software / SaaS (B2B) | Enterprise software, cloud services, IT infrastructure, cybersecurity | Software companies selling to other businesses. Data-driven, fast adopters, understand the value of intelligence. |
| **Tier 2** | Wholesale / Distribution (B2B) | Technical wholesale, industrial distribution | Large customer bases, partner models, high signal volume. |
| **Avoid** | Professional services / Consultancies | Management consulting, legal, accounting | No physical product, different sales motion, doesn't fit partnership model. |
| **Avoid** | Pure B2C | Retail, consumer goods (end consumer) | Sales Intelligence not relevant for consumer sales. |

**Core principle:** The ideal DACH customer makes something (physical product or software) and sells it to other businesses.

## Target Buyer Profile

### Primary Decision Makers (by company size)

**Smaller companies (50-500 employees / Mittelstand):**

| Role | Relevance | Entry point? |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **CEO / Geschäftsführer** | **Primary** | **Yes -- most likely first contact.** In smaller companies, the GF makes the call. |
| **Vertriebsleiter (if exists)** | High | Sometimes first contact if there's a dedicated sales leader |
| **Marketingleiter / Head of Marketing** | Medium | Influencer -- especially when Marketing Intelligence module becomes relevant |

**Larger companies (500+ employees):**

| Role | Relevance | Entry point? |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Head of Sales / Vertriebsleiter** | **Primary** | **Yes -- most likely first contact.** Owns the pipeline, feels the pain directly. |
| **CEO / Geschäftsführer** | Very high | Budget sponsor, needs to approve. Expand to this person. |
| **CMO / Head of Marketing** | Medium-High | Influencer -- alignment on demand gen, pipeline quality, Marketing Intelligence module |
| **CFO** | Medium | Budget approval influencer |

> **Important: Stay away from IT/CTO/CDO.** These roles slow down deals, add technical complexity, and shift the conversation away from business value. If GDPR/hosting questions arise, handle them proactively with documentation -- don't invite IT to the table. Keep the conversation in Sales and C-level.

### Typical Buying Committee (DACH)

| Size | Composition | Decision dynamic |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Mittelstand (50-500)** | Geschäftsführer + Vertriebsleiter (+ Marketing if relevant) | 2-3 people. GF decides. Fast if GF is convinced. |
| **Mid-market (500-2,000)** | VP Sales + CMO/Marketing + CFO + CEO | 3-5 people. Consensus-driven. Need internal champion. |
| **Enterprise (2,000+)** | VP Sales + CMO + Procurement + C-level sponsor | 4-6 people. Formal process. Long cycle. |

## Pain Points (DACH-Specific)

### Universal Pain Points (Same as global)
1. **Time waste:** 70%+ of sales time spent on admin (research, CRM updates, data entry)
2. **Pipeline quality:** Too many unqualified leads, too few real opportunities
3. **Capacity underutilization:** 3-5 calls/day, "What are they doing the other 7 hours?"
4. **CRM data quality:** "The company name is correct but the rest is garbage"

### DACH-Specific Pain Points
5. **GDPR anxiety:** "We can't use American tools -- Datenschutz won't allow it"
6. **Expansion difficulty:** "We want to grow internationally but don't have enough people on the ground"
7. **Mittelstand conservatism:** Long decision cycles, need proof before buying, "We've always done it this way"
8. **Market stagnation:** DACH manufacturing in particular facing economic headwinds -- need to find the 5% who are still buying
9. **Language barrier for tools:** Most sales intelligence tools are English-only, with poor EU data quality

## Buying Triggers (When to reach out)

| Trigger | Signal | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **New sales leadership** | VP Sales or CRO hired | Very High |
| **Growth targets announced** | Annual report, press release, earnings call | Very High |
| **Market expansion plans** | Job postings in new regions, new office announcements | High |
| **Digital transformation initiative** | CDO hired, AI budget approved | High |
| **Competitor tool dissatisfaction** | Complaints about ZoomInfo EU data, Dealfront limitations | High |
| **Sales team scaling** | Multiple sales roles posted | Medium-High |
| **M&A activity** | Acquisition announced -- need to integrate sales teams | Medium |
| **Economic pressure** | Revenue decline, cost-cutting programs -- need efficiency | Medium |

---

## Competitive Encounters (DACH)

| Competitor | How often encountered | Their weakness in DACH | Our counter |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **None / Manual process** | **Most common** | They don't know what they're missing | "Your top sellers spend 70% of their time on research. That's not a strategy, that's a waste." |
| **Excel / self-built lists** | Very common | No signals, no automation, no scalability | "You're doing manually what AI agents can do 24/7 -- and finding things you'd never find." |
| **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** | Occasional | No signals, no lookalikes, no agent orchestration | "LinkedIn shows you who exists. We show you who's ready to buy." |
| **Dealfront** | Rare | European but no agentic AI, no orchestration | "Data provider vs. intelligence layer. We don't just deliver data -- we deliver action." |
| **ZoomInfo / Cognism** | Rare | US/UK-based, GDPR bolt-on, poor EU data | "Built in America, retrofitted for Europe. We're built in Europe, for Europe." |

**Key insight:** The main "competitor" in DACH is not a tool -- it's the status quo. Most prospects don't use any sales intelligence tool yet. The sale is about creating the category, not switching from a competitor.

**Tier 4 (EUR 5-10K MRR / 45 days)**
- Smaller Mittelstand, growing companies

## Success Metrics for DACH

### MRR Targets

| Milestone | Target MRR | Timeline |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **End of Q1 2026** | EUR 25,000 | March 2026 |

### Current Pipeline (DACH)

| Company | Location | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **UZIN UTZ** | Ulm, Germany | In talks | Building materials. Closest to standard SI pitch deck. |
| **Erler Automation** | Dormettingen, Germany | In talks | Automation / manufacturing. Tier 1 industry fit. |
| **SOLCOM** | Reutlingen, Germany | In talks | IT project services. Personal connection to CEO -- not typical ICP, opportunistic entry. |

### First Client (Global)

| Company | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **dobby.io** | Denmark | First paying client (technically Nordics, not DACH) |

> **Note:** The geographic cluster (all Baden-Württemberg) reflects Malte's personal network being leveraged pre-launch, not a strategic geographic focus. As DACH scales, pipeline will diversify across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The ICP-relevant pipeline entries are UZIN UTZ (building materials) and Erler Automation (manufacturing) -- both Tier 1 industry fit.

## Appendix: DACH Market Notes

- **Mittelstand** is the backbone of the German economy. These companies (often EUR 50M-500M revenue, 200-2,000 employees) are highly suitable because they have B2B sales teams, growth ambitions, but limited resources for scaling.
- **"Hidden Champions"** (world market leaders in niche segments) are ideal targets -- they have unique products (fits the exclusivity principle) and international ambitions.
- **German decision-making** is consensus-driven. Expect 3-5 stakeholders minimum. Budget decisions often require Geschäftsführung approval.
- **Datenschutz** is not just compliance -- it's cultural. German buyers feel personally responsible for data decisions. Leading with GDPR-native architecture removes their biggest fear.
