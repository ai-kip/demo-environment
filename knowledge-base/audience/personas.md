## Persona 1: VP Sales / Head of Sales

### Profile
- **Role:** Responsible for sales results and pipeline
- **Company:** Mid-market or enterprise with B2B sales in Europe
- **Reports to:** CEO / Managing Director
- **Team:** 5-50 salespeople

### Pain Points
- Team spends too much time researching, too little selling
- CRM data is outdated ("Company name is correct, everything else is garbage")
- No visibility into buying signals -- who's ready to buy right now?
- Capacity is underutilized (3-5 calls/day instead of possible 15+)
- Conversion rates are too low
- Expansion into new markets is tedious

### What They Want to Hear
- **Numbers:** "300-500% uplift in qualified meetings"
- **Time savings:** "No more wasting time on research -- only prioritize warm leads"
- **Commission:** "Much easier for sales and they will get a higher commission"
- **Capacity:** "Your 2-person team can be as effective as a 10-person team"
- **Lookalikes:** "We have customers. Find us more customers like our customers."

### Objections
- "Won't this monitor my people?" -> Empowerment frame
- "We've tried X before and it didn't work" -> Difference from generic AI
- "What about GDPR?" -> Address proactively, German hosting

### Boss-Ready Pitch for This Persona
> "AI-KIP automatically finds companies similar to our best customers and shows our sales team when they're ready to buy. Our reps only spend time on warm leads."

## Persona 2: CEO / Managing Director

### Profile
- **Role:** Strategic direction, growth responsibility
- **Company:** Mid-market, often owner-managed
- **Focus:** Scaling, new markets, competitive advantage

### Pain Points
- "Everyone talks about AI but we have no strategy"
- AI projects fail or don't deliver promised ROI
- Fear of falling behind
- Fragmented AI tools without an orchestrating layer (AI silos)
- People as the limiting factor for growth

### What They Want to Hear
- **Fourth Pillar:** "Alongside people, process, and resources, you need an intelligence layer"
- **Inevitability:** "In 12-24 months, every successful organization will use these tools"
- **Independence:** "We're self-funded -- no investors dictating our direction"
- **Experience:** "5 software companies in 15 years, last exit at EUR 2 billion"
- **Optimization:** "It's an optimization problem, not a replacement problem"

### Boss-Ready Pitch for This Persona
> "AI-KIP is an intelligence layer that orchestrates AI agents across your entire organization. Instead of 10 isolated AI tools, you have one system that works together."

## Persona 3: CTO / IT Director

### Profile
- **Role:** Technical infrastructure, data privacy, integration
- **Focus:** Security, compliance, architecture decisions

### Pain Points
- GDPR compliance for new tools
- Integration with existing infrastructure
- Data control and sovereignty
- Vendor lock-in fears
- "Where is the data hosted?"

### What They Want to Hear
- **Hosting:** "Schwarz IT and StackIT. German tech stack. Locally installable."
- **Control:** "The employee always controls which data is connected"
- **European:** "We deliberately built this as a European company. No American tech stack."
- **Data sources:** "Chamber of commerce, Dun & Bradstreet, Google Maps verified..."
- **On-premise:** "We can install it locally on a machine at your headquarters"

### Boss-Ready Pitch for This Persona
> "AI-KIP is GDPR-compliant, hosted on German servers, and can be installed locally if needed. No American tech stack."

## Persona 4: Marketing / Demand Gen Leader

### Profile
- **Role:** Lead generation, campaigns, marketing strategy
- **Focus:** Qualified leads, account-based marketing, content strategy

### Pain Points
- Lacking data foundation for targeted campaigns
- No visibility into intent signals
- Marketing and sales are misaligned
- Investing in markets without data foundation

### What They Want to Hear
- **Signals:** "1 million+ market signals daily. Job postings, annual reports, new locations, factory permits"
- **Lookalikes:** "We abstract the ideal customer profile from your existing customers"
- **33M companies:** "All registered companies in Europe in our database"
- **Three targeting layers:** "Ideal customer, right person at right time, buying signals"

## Decision-Maker Dynamics

In B2B buying decisions, there is no fixed rule. The decision-maker is often unclear:

> "There's no rule. You have to call there... 1 out of 10, 9 out of 10 are not interested."

### Our Strategy
1. **Stakeholder expansion:** Always ask about the decision-maker and invite them to the follow-up conversation
2. **Multi-persona approach:** Prepare materials for each persona (VP Sales, CEO, CTO)
3. **Hidden stakeholders:** AI-KIP identifies hidden concerns in buying cycles ("The engineer asked these questions. I didn't notice it during the meeting.")
