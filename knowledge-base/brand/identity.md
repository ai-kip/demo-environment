## Origin Story

AI-KIP started as Michael Uenk's MBA thesis. At the time, everyone said he was crazy. 10 years later, the vision became reality -- when the team found Aleksandr Drozd, who made the technical implementation possible.

> "This was my final thesis. Back then everybody was saying that I was crazy... then we found Alex who actually made it work."
> -- Michael Uenk, CEO

The founders deliberately chose to forgo external funding:

> "I really want to be self funded. To have our own direction and not have a board of directors behind you saying you need to do this."
> -- Michael Uenk

## Mission

**Scale organizations by integrating AI agents with cutting-edge technology.**

We enable companies to seamlessly integrate AI agents into their existing processes and value chains -- not as a replacement for people, but as an amplification of human capabilities.

---

## Vision (North Star)

> "Multiply the impact of organizations a hundredfold by enabling humans and AI agents to work together in seamless harmony."

(Original German: "Die Wirkung von Organisationen soll verhundertfacht werden, indem Menschen und KI-Agenten in nahtloser Harmonie zusammenarbeiten koennen.")

## Core Values

### 1. European Independence
We are a European software company. We don't use an American tech stack. Everything is hosted in Europe (Schwarz IT / StackIT). We can install locally on a machine at the customer's headquarters if needed.

### 2. Partnership over Vendor Relationship
We are selective about partnerships. We say no 9 out of 10 times. We don't work with direct competitors of our customers. Every partner must bring something unique.

### 3. Empowerment over Surveillance
Our tools mirror insights to the employees themselves -- not to management. It's about helping people get to the sale faster.

### 4. Transparency & Trust
We proactively explain where our data comes from, how it's controlled, and why our architecture is GDPR-compliant. We don't wait for objections.

### 5. Simplicity in Communication
Complex concepts must be explainable in simple terms. If a prospect can't explain it to their boss in one sentence, we've failed.

## The Fourth Pillar -- Core Thesis

Organizations traditionally rest on three pillars:
1. **People**
2. **Process**
3. **Resources**

AI-KIP introduces the **fourth pillar**: **Intelligence**.

This intelligence layer orchestrates AI agents across all departments -- not as a replacement for existing pillars, but as a new dimension that connects and amplifies everything.

> **Important for communication:** The "Fourth Pillar" concept is suited for strategic conversations with C-level. In first contact and marketing materials, lead with the concrete benefit (lookalikes, signals, time savings) -- not with platform architecture. Internally we've learned: "People don't get the fourth pillar, it's too fake for them... need to focus on sales intelligence."
